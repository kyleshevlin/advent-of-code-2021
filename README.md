# Advent of Code 2021

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles for 2021.

I'm using plain JavaScript for my solutions, using Node to run my scripts.

Each day has its own directory. The solutions can be found under `index.js`, with a few tests in `index.test.js` to verify some of the functions and algorithms created to solve that day's problems.

Hope you enjoy!
